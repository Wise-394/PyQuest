starfish: Hello, traveler! Welcome to your lesson on [b]Python sets[/b]!  
starfish: A set is like a special collection box that only keeps unique items and automatically removes duplicates!  
starfish: What would you like to learn first?  
- What is a set? => set_intro  
- How is a set different from a list? => set_vs_list  
- How do I make a set? => create_set  
- I know the basics, show me more => main_menu  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ set_intro
starfish: Great question! Let's explore sets together.  
starfish: Imagine you're collecting rare gems. You don't want two of the same gem, right?  
starfish: A set automatically keeps only unique items. If you try to add a duplicate, it ignores it!  
starfish: Example: [br]gems = {'ruby', 'sapphire', 'ruby'}  
starfish: Even though we added 'ruby' twice, the set only keeps one: {'ruby', 'sapphire'}  
starfish: Sets are perfect when you need unique values!  
- That's interesting! How is it different from a list? => set_vs_list  
- Show me how to create one => create_set  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ set_vs_list
starfish: Good thinking! Sets and lists are similar but have key differences:  
starfish: [b]Lists:[/b]  
starfish: • Keep duplicates: [1, 2, 2, 3] stays as is  
starfish: • Remember order: Items stay in the order you added them  
starfish: • Use brackets: my_list = [1, 2, 3]  
starfish: [b]Sets:[/b]  
starfish: • Remove duplicates: {1, 2, 2, 3} becomes {1, 2, 3}  
starfish: • No guaranteed order: Items can appear in any order  
starfish: • Use curly braces: my_set = {1, 2, 3}  
- I see! When should I use sets? => when_to_use  
- Show me how to create sets => create_set  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ when_to_use
starfish: Sets are perfect for specific situations!  
starfish: [b]Use sets when:[/b]  
starfish: • You need unique values (no duplicates)  
starfish: • You want to check if something exists (very fast!)  
starfish: • You need to find common items between collections  
starfish: [b]Use lists when:[/b]  
starfish: • Order matters  
starfish: • You need duplicates  
starfish: • You need to access items by position  
- Got it! How do I create a set? => create_set  
- What can I do with sets? => main_menu  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ create_set
starfish: Creating a set is easy! Here are the ways:  
starfish: [b]Method 1:[/b] Use curly braces { }  
starfish: [br]my_set = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}  
starfish: [b]Method 2:[/b] Use the set() function  
starfish: [br]my_set = set(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'])  
starfish: [b]Method 3:[/b] Create an empty set  
starfish: [br]empty_set = set()  
starfish: ⚠️ Warning: {} creates an empty dictionary, NOT a set! Use set() instead.  
- I understand! What can I do with sets? => main_menu  
- Can I add items to a set? => add_intro  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ add_intro
starfish: Absolutely! You can add items to sets, and they're smart about duplicates!  
starfish: Use [b]add()[/b] to add a single item:  
starfish: [br]inventory = {'sword', 'shield'}  
starfish: [br]inventory.add('potion')  
starfish: Now your set is: {'sword', 'shield', 'potion'}  
starfish: Watch what happens with duplicates:  
starfish: [br]inventory.add('sword')  
starfish: Nothing changes! The set already has 'sword', so it ignores it.  
- Can I add multiple items at once? => add_multiple  
- How do I remove items? => remove_intro  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ add_multiple
starfish: Yes! Use [b]update()[/b] to add multiple items:  
starfish: [br]inventory = {'sword', 'shield'}  
starfish: [br]inventory.update(['potion', 'map', 'sword'])  
starfish: Now your set is: {'sword', 'shield', 'potion', 'map'}  
starfish: Notice 'sword' wasn't added again because it already existed!  
starfish: You can also update with another set:  
starfish: [br]inventory.update({'compass', 'rope'})  
- Cool! How do I remove items? => remove_intro  
- What else can I do? => main_menu  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ remove_intro
starfish: There are several ways to remove items from a set!  
starfish: [b]remove()[/b] - Remove an item (throws error if not found):  
starfish: [br]inventory = {'sword', 'shield', 'potion'}  
starfish: [br]inventory.remove('shield')  
starfish: Now: {'sword', 'potion'}  
starfish: ⚠️ If you try: inventory.remove('helmet'), Python will give you an error!  
- Is there a safer way to remove? => remove_safe  
- Show me other removal methods => remove_advanced  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ remove_safe
starfish: Yes! Use [b]discard()[/b] - it won't complain if the item doesn't exist:  
starfish: [br]inventory = {'sword', 'shield', 'potion'}  
starfish: [br]inventory.discard('helmet')  
starfish: No error! It just does nothing if 'helmet' isn't there.  
starfish: [br]inventory.discard('sword')  
starfish: This works and removes 'sword': {'shield', 'potion'}  
starfish: This is safer when you're not sure if an item exists!  
- Are there other ways to remove items? => remove_advanced  
- Let me explore other operations => main_menu  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ remove_advanced
starfish: Here are more removal methods:  
starfish: [b]pop()[/b] - Remove and return a random item:  
starfish: [br]item = inventory.pop()  
starfish: This removes one item and saves it in 'item'  
starfish: (You don't know which one because sets aren't ordered!)  
starfish: [b]clear()[/b] - Empty the entire set:  
starfish: [br]inventory.clear()  
starfish: Now your set is completely empty: set()  
- I want to learn about set operations => operations_intro  
- Let me practice other things => main_menu  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ operations_intro
starfish: Sets have powerful operations! These are perfect for comparing collections.  
starfish: Let's say you have two groups of adventurers:  
starfish: [br]team_a = {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}  
starfish: [br]team_b = {'Bob', 'Diana', 'Eve'}  
starfish: What would you like to learn?  
- Find items in both sets => union_op  
- Find common items => intersection_op  
- Find differences => difference_op  
- Show me all operations => all_operations  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ union_op
starfish: [b]Union[/b] combines all unique items from both sets!  
starfish: [br]team_a = {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}  
starfish: [br]team_b = {'Bob', 'Diana', 'Eve'}  
starfish: [br]everyone = team_a | team_b  
starfish: or: everyone = team_a.union(team_b)  
starfish: Result: {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve'}  
starfish: Notice 'Bob' appears only once, even though he's in both teams!  
- What about finding common items? => intersection_op  
- Show me other operations => operations_intro  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ intersection_op
starfish: [b]Intersection[/b] finds items that exist in BOTH sets!  
starfish: [br]team_a = {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}  
starfish: [br]team_b = {'Bob', 'Diana', 'Eve'}  
starfish: [br]common = team_a & team_b  
starfish: or: common = team_a.intersection(team_b)  
starfish: Result: {'Bob'}  
starfish: Only 'Bob' is in both teams!  
- How do I find differences? => difference_op  
- Show me other operations => operations_intro  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ difference_op
starfish: [b]Difference[/b] finds items in one set but NOT the other!  
starfish: [br]team_a = {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}  
starfish: [br]team_b = {'Bob', 'Diana', 'Eve'}  
starfish: [br]only_in_a = team_a - team_b  
starfish: or: only_in_a = team_a.difference(team_b)  
starfish: Result: {'Alice', 'Charlie'}  
starfish: These are the people only in team_a!  
starfish: You can also find symmetric difference (items in either set but not both):  
starfish: [br]unique_to_each = team_a ^ team_b  
starfish: Result: {'Alice', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve'}  
- Show me all operations together => all_operations  
- I want to practice other things => main_menu  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ all_operations
starfish: Here's a summary of set operations:  
starfish: [b]Union (|)[/b] - All items from both sets  
starfish: [br]a | b or a.union(b)  
starfish: [b]Intersection (&)[/b] - Items in both sets  
starfish: [br]a & b or a.intersection(b)  
starfish: [b]Difference (-)[/b] - Items in first set but not second  
starfish: [br]a - b or a.difference(b)  
starfish: [b]Symmetric Difference (^)[/b] - Items in either set but not both  
starfish: [br]a ^ b or a.symmetric_difference(b)  
- Can I check if something is in a set? => membership_check  
- Let me explore other features => main_menu  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ membership_check
starfish: Yes! Checking membership in sets is super fast!  
starfish: Use the [b]in[/b] keyword:  
starfish: [br]inventory = {'sword', 'shield', 'potion'}  
starfish: [br]if 'sword' in inventory:  
starfish: [br]    print("You have a sword!")  
starfish: This prints: You have a sword!  
starfish: [br]if 'helmet' not in inventory:  
starfish: [br]    print("You need a helmet!")  
starfish: This prints: You need a helmet!  
starfish: 💡 Fun fact: Checking membership in sets is much faster than in lists!  
- Can I check relationships between sets? => subset_check  
- Show me other things => main_menu  
- I want to exit => end_dialog

~ subset_check
starfish: Yes! You can check if one set is contained in another!  
starfish: [br]basic_items = {'sword', 'shield'}  
starfish: [br]all_items = {'sword', 'shield', 'potion', 'map'}  
starfish: [b]Subset[/b] - Is one set contained in another?  
starfish: [br]basic_items.issubset(all_items)  
starfish: Returns: True (all basic items are in all_items)  
starfish: [b]Superset[/b] - Does one set contain another?  
starfish: [br]all_items.issuperset(basic_items)  
starfish: Returns: True (all_items contains all basic items)  
starfish: [b]Disjoint[/b] - Do sets have NO items in common?  
starfish: [br]team_a.isdisjoint(team_b)
