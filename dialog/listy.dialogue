starfish: Hello, traveler! Welcome to your lesson on [b]Python lists[/b]!  
starfish: A list is like a backpack where you can store many items together. Instead of having separate variables for each item, you can keep them all in one place!  
starfish: What would you like to learn first?  
- What is a list? => list_intro  
- How do I make a list? => create_list
- How do I use items in a list? => access_intro  
- I know the basics, show me more => main_menu  

~ list_intro
starfish: Great question! Let's start simple.  
starfish: Imagine you're going on an adventure. You need to carry: a sword, a shield, and a potion.  
starfish: Instead of writing: [br]item1 = 'sword' [br]item2 = 'shield' [br]item3 = 'potion'  
starfish: You can use a list to keep them together: [br]inventory = ['sword', 'shield', 'potion']  
starfish: Much easier, right? One variable holds everything!  
- That makes sense! Show me how to create one => create_list  
- I want to see more examples => list_examples  

~ list_examples
starfish: Sure! Here are more examples of lists:  
starfish: Numbers: [br]scores = [10, 25, 30, 15]  
starfish: Names: [br]players = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']  
starfish: Mixed items: [br]stuff = ['apple', 42, 'banana', 7]  
starfish: You can even have an empty list: [br]empty_bag = []  
- Got it! How do I create my own list? => create_list  
- What can I do with lists? => main_menu  

~ create_list
starfish: Creating a list is easy! Just follow these steps:  
starfish: Step 1: Think of a name for your list (like 'inventory' or 'friends')  
starfish: Step 2: Use the = sign  
starfish: Step 3: Put your items inside [ ] brackets, separated by commas  
starfish: Example: [br]my_list = ['first item', 'second item', 'third item']  
starfish: Remember: Use quotes '' for text, but not for numbers!  
- I understand! What's next? => access_intro  
- Can I see more examples? => list_examples  
- Show me what else I can do => main_menu  

~ access_intro
starfish: Now let's learn how to get items OUT of your list!  
starfish: Each item in your list has a number, called an [b]index[/b].  
starfish: Here's the tricky part: Python starts counting from 0, not 1!  
starfish: Let's say: [br]fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']  
starfish: • 'apple' is at position 0  
starfish: • 'banana' is at position 1  
starfish: • 'cherry' is at position 2  
- That's confusing! Why start at 0? => why_zero  
- I get it! How do I use this? => access_examples  

~ why_zero
starfish: Good question! It seems weird at first, doesn't it?  
starfish: Think of it like floors in some buildings: Ground floor = 0, First floor = 1, etc.  
starfish: Most programming languages start counting at 0. You'll get used to it quickly!  
starfish: Just remember: First item = 0, Second item = 1, Third item = 2, and so on.  
- Okay, I'll remember that! => access_examples  
- Show me how to use positions => access_examples  

~ access_examples
starfish: Let's practice getting items from a list!  
starfish: [br]inventory = ['sword', 'shield', 'potion']  
starfish: To get the first item: [br]print(inventory[0]) [br]→ This shows: sword  
starfish: To get the second item: [br]print(inventory[1]) [br]→ This shows: shield  
starfish: Cool trick! Use -1 to get the LAST item: [br]print(inventory[-1]) [br]→ This shows: potion  
- That's neat! What else can I do? => main_menu  
- Can I change items in my list? => modify_intro  

~ modify_intro
starfish: Yes! You can change items in your list anytime you want.  
starfish: This is called [b]modifying[/b] a list. Let's see how!  
starfish: Say you have: [br]inventory = ['sword', 'shield', 'potion']  
starfish: To change the first item to something better:  
starfish: [br]inventory[0] = 'magic sword' [br]print(inventory)  
starfish: Now your list is: ['magic sword', 'shield', 'potion']  
starfish: You just upgraded your sword! ⚔️  
- Cool! Can I add NEW items too? => add_intro  
- Let me see other things I can do => main_menu  

~ add_intro
starfish: Absolutely! Let's learn how to add items to your list.  
starfish: The easiest way is using [b]append()[/b]. It adds an item to the END of your list.  
starfish: Example: [br]inventory = ['sword', 'shield'] [br]inventory.append('potion')  
starfish: Now your inventory is: ['sword', 'shield', 'potion']  
starfish: Think of it like putting something at the bottom of your backpack!  
- That's simple! What if I want to add items elsewhere? => add_advanced  
- Can I remove items too? => remove_intro  
- Show me everything I can do => main_menu  

~ add_advanced
starfish: Great thinking! There are more ways to add items:  
starfish: [b]insert()[/b] - Put an item at a specific spot:  
starfish: [br]inventory.insert(1, 'helmet')  
starfish: This puts 'helmet' at position 1 (the second spot)  
starfish: [b]extend()[/b] - Add multiple items at once:  
starfish: [br]inventory.extend(['map', 'compass'])  
starfish: This adds both 'map' and 'compass' to the end!  
- Got it! Can I remove items? => remove_intro  
- Let me practice other things => main_menu  

~ remove_intro
starfish: Yes! Sometimes you need to get rid of items in your list.  
starfish: The easiest way is using [b]remove()[/b]:  
starfish: [br]inventory = ['sword', 'shield', 'potion', 'shield']  
starfish: [br]inventory.remove('shield')  
starfish: Now your list is: ['sword', 'potion', 'shield']  
starfish: Notice: It only removed the FIRST 'shield' it found!  
starfish: ⚠️ Warning: If the item doesn't exist, Python will complain with an error!  
- Are there other ways to remove items? => remove_advanced  
- I think I understand lists now! => wrap_up  

~ remove_advanced
starfish: Yes! Here are more ways to remove items:  
starfish: [b]pop()[/b] - Remove an item by its position:  
starfish: [br]item = inventory.pop(0)  
starfish: This removes the first item AND saves it in 'item'  
starfish: [b]del[/b] - Delete an item by position:  
starfish: [br]del inventory[1]  
starfish: This deletes the second item  
starfish: [b]clear()[/b] - Empty the entire list:  
starfish: [br]inventory.clear()  
starfish: Now your list is completely empty: []  
- I've learned a lot! Let me review => wrap_up  
- I want to practice something else => main_menu  

~ main_menu

~ wrap_up
starfish: Wonderful! Let's review what you learned about lists:  
starfish: ✨ [b]Creating a list:[/b]  
starfish: [br]my_list = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']  
starfish: 📍 [b]Getting items:[/b]  
starfish: [br]my_list[0] gets the first item  
starfish: [br]my_list[-1] gets the last item  
starfish: ✏️ [b]Changing items:[/b]  
starfish: [br]my_list[0] = 'new item'  
starfish: ➕ [b]Adding items:[/b]  
starfish: [br]my_list.append('new item') adds to the end  
starfish: ➖ [b]Removing items:[/b]  
starfish: [br]my_list.remove('item1') removes that item  
starfish: [b]Remember:[/b] Lists start counting at 0, and you can change them anytime!
